[React](https://reactjs.org) is currently the most popular, modern UI framework for the web. 

It's well known for its functional, declarative style and I would argue it's really easy to get your head around.
The structure of an application (and its JSX syntax) feels close to HTML, so it's easy to follow logic.

It's well worth trying React if you are a developer or are interested in learning front-end development.

When first building a React application you have a few options available. 

- You can add a couple script tags to the HTML and then React should work. 
However this isn't the recommended approach for a production site.
- You can also run `npx create-react-app my-app` to have [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
automatically setup a project for you with all the tools you need under the hood.
- You can build the tooling yourself and learn more about how the tools work.

I tend to recommend the last option as knowing your tools enhances your ability as a developer.

The rest of this post will cover how to setup a React application with a build tool, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

I have covered how to build JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using webpack [in a previous post](https://jon.haddow.me/blog/basic-setup-for-a-web-application), so that is worth reading first if unfamiliar.
