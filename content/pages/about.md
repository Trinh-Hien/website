# Hi! I'm Jon :wave:

I am a full stack web engineer based in Swansea, Wales.

I work at [CDSM](https://www.cdsm.co.uk/) building high-quality, scalable, e-learning web applications.

I am skilled in React, TypeScript, C#, and .NET Core. I also have experience in CSS (and Sass), AWS, and building static sites using GatsbyJS (like this [one](https://github.com/jonhaddow/website/)!).

I am passionate about open source projects. I am aiming to contribute to more projects this next year. Check out my progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonhaddow/).

I live in Swansea with my wife (Mollie), two boys (Oakley and Killian) and dog (Rufus :dog:).
